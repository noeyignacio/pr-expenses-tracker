#### üèóÔ∏è **Project Description**: This project helps you track your expenses and income everyday. Every *transaction* you add, it automatically adds the what date and time you add it on the system. You can remove a certain *transaction(s)*, this is for typographical error, user error or maybe if some bugs occurred.

#### üßë‚Äçüíª **Dev Thoughts About The Project**: This project helps me to be a *[Full-Stack Developer](https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/)* someday, baby-step progress. It introduce me on how [API(s)](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api#:~:text=API%20is%20the%20acronym%20for,you're%20using%20an%20API.) works, how to communicate from [backend](https://techterms.com/definition/backend#:~:text=In%20the%20computer%20world%2C%20the,program's%20or%20website's%20user%20interface.&text=Everything%20that%20happens%20before%20the,is%20part%20of%20the%20backend) to server and [frontend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development)/client to [backend](https://techterms.com/definition/backend#:~:text=In%20the%20computer%20world%2C%20the,program's%20or%20website's%20user%20interface.&text=Everything%20that%20happens%20before%20the,is%20part%20of%20the%20backend), how to create a [Model/Schema](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-mongoose-for-mongodb-d2a7aa593c57/#:~:text=A%20Mongoose%20schema%20defines%20the,updating%2C%20deleting%20records%2C%20etc) using *[mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)*, it taught me on how to create a readable backend-infrastructure-code and also frontend-infrastructure-code, it also helps me to be productive as i can and use [Google](https://www.google.com/) efficently/effectively and most especially, i learned how to work with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
